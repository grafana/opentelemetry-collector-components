# OpenTelemetry Collector components by Grafana Labs

This repository will contain a set of components created by Grafana Labs and not available upstream ([open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) or [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/)), typically because the components are experimental.

You will also find our custom distributions, mostly suitable for usage with Grafana Cloud.

We prefer to contribute upstream, which is why we see this repository here as only a temporary home for most components.
